    <h1>3D Viewer Controls</h1>
    
    <h2>FOV:</h2>
    <p>The field of view (fov) setting is meant to be set to match the fov of the camera used to capture the image data that is being visualized. Larger values have the effect of 'spreading out' distant parts of the scene.</p>
    <p>Telephoto lenses tend to have low fov values, while action cameras (e.g. GoPro) have large fov values.</p>
    
    <h2>Near Plane:</h2>
    <p>This value acts as a kind of 'fudge factor' in the mesh generation formula. It is roughly equivalent to something like a focal length but is scaled by the minimum depth mapping.</p>
    <p>Changing this value often has a bending effect on the resulting mesh, so can be useful for counter-acting bending (though adjusting the minimum depth is usually a better idea).</p>
    
    <h2>Z-Offset:</h2>
    <p>This value controls a baseline depth positioning of the viewing camera. When set to 0, the camera will orbit the closest part of the 3D scene, if set to 100 the camera will orbit the farthest point of the scene.</p>
    <p>The camera can still be freely moved/panned in ways that also adjust the depth positioning. This value just provides a baseline that takes effect without needing to move the camera manually.</p>
    
    <h2>Max Depth:</h2>
    <p>This value represents the distance to the farthest part of the scene (or at least, distance of the farthest predicted depth from the DPT model). This value does not represent a specific unit (e.g. meters) but is instead proportional to the x/y sizing of the image.</p>
    <p>A good way to set this value is to switch to using orthographic projection and then adjust this value until the scene 'looks correct', that is, objects appear to have the correct relative proportions and sizings.</p>
    
    <h2>Min Depth:</h2>
    <p>This value is meant to determine the distance (depth) to the closest object in the image. It is specified as a percentage of the maximum depth. For example, a <b>Min Depth</b> of 100 would imply that the closest object is the same distance from the camera as the farthest object, resulting in a flat 3D surface.</p>
    <p>A good way to set this value is to first guess at a reasonable <b>Max Depth</b>, then adjust the <b>Min Depth</b> until the shape/proportions of the 3D mesh look correct. For example for scenes containing distant objects, changes to the <b>Min Depth</b> can often alter the curvature of the ground itself. If you know that the ground is flat in your image, then the <b>Min Depth</b> can be adjusted until the ground is flat in the 3D surface.</p>
    
    <h2>Mesh Density:</h2>
    <p>This value controls the number of triangles used to create the 3D mesh for display. Higher values will improve the detail of the mesh, but can be slower to render.</p>
    <p>The number of faces will be given by: max_faces * (density/100)<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>(where max_faces defaults to 5 million)</p>
    
    <h2>Mesh Jitter:</h2>
    <p>By default, the 3D mesh is generated using a simple grid of points. The jitter value randomizes the positioning of points within the grid, which can reduce the appearance of repetitive patterns.</p>
    <p>It's easiest to see the effect of jitter when using low mesh density values. A jitter value of 0 fully disables the effect.</p>
    
    <h2>Mask Threshold:</h2>
    <p>This threshold can be used to exclude regions of the 3D mesh based on a provided mask. By default, an 'edge detection' mask is produced, so this control can be used to remove the often messy data around the edges of objects.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, a mask image can be provided when running the 3D viewer server (using the -k flag), in which case this threshold will be applied to the provided mask.</p>

    <h2>Display Resolution:</h2>
    <p>This control can be used to downscale the displayed image. This can improve rendering speeds as well as help blend together point rendering.</p>
    
    <h2>Use Ortho Camera:</h2>
    <p>If enabled, the viewing camera (e.g. your view point) will use orthographic projection instead of perspective projection. With orthographic projections, objects will appear the same size no matter how far away they are from the camera.</p>
    <p>This can be especially helpful when trying to adjust settings to obtain an accurate 3D representation of the scene.</p>
    
    <h2>Use Triangles:</h2>
    <p>If enabled, the 3D surface will be rendered using triangles instead of points, resulting in a more solid looking surface.</p>
    
    <h2>Use Depth Image:</h2>
    <p>If enabled, the depth map will be used to texture the 3D surface (as a black-and-white image) instead of the original RGB source image.</p>

    <h2>Top-down Image:</h2>
    <p>Intended to be used when working with images that are taken from a top-down perspective. When enabled, the camera controls will be altered.</p>

    <h1>Extra Controls</h1>
    
    <p>Several additional control values can be modified using the console (F12) in the browser. These controls are not really meant for interactive changes but can affect the visualization. These values can be modified using the global variable: CTRLS</p>
    <p>For example, you can change the maximum depth value using: CTRLS.depth_limit = 500</p>
    <p>This will alter the effect of the existing <b>Max Depth</b> control value, though the change won't be visible until the viewport is updated (e.g. by moving the camera)</p>
