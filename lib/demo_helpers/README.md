# Demo Helpers


This folder contains scripts that help implement the functionality seen in the demo scripts ([run_image.py](https://github.com/heyoeyo/muggled_dpt/blob/main/run_image.py) & [run_video.py](https://github.com/heyoeyo/muggled_dpt/blob/main/run_video.py)). These helpers are not needed to understand or use the DPT models, but may be helpful if you want to make your own image or video processing scripts.
