# v3.1 SwinV2

This folder contains the major pieces of the SwinV2 DPT model, in correspondence with figure 1 from the preprint: ["Vision Transformers for Dense Prediction"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.13413), along with Swin-specific modifications described in the follow-up paper: ["MiDaS v3.1 -- A Model Zoo for Robust Monocular Relative Depth Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14460).

For a more compreshensive description of the DPT model components, please see the existing [BEiT documentation](https://github.com/heyoeyo/muggled_dpt/tree/main/lib/v31_beit). The focus here is on describing the details which are unique to the SwinV2 models.
